     <p>Hi this is Pavan. I am going to create a mobile app.</p>
                <p>
                    This app will be useful for people in buying Fruites. This project is given by RSS. Feeling proud to work for RSS.
                </p>
                 <p> I have a brilliant girl in my Team named Harika. She can complete sudoku in easy level in 1.20 sec. and hard level 10 to 11 min.

             <input type="submit" value = "submit" id="s_t">
          
            <ul id="pnamelist">
